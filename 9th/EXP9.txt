✅ Step 1: Confirm ActiveMQ Web Console
Make sure ActiveMQ is running
https://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/download/classic-05-19-01

cd "C:\apache-activemq-5.19.1-bin\apache-activemq-5.19.1\bin"

Start ActiveMQ (Windows):
cmd - activemq.bat start

Open Command Prompt (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin) and go to the bin folder of the extracted

for 9th
https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases?version=11
setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-11.0.29.7-hotspot"
.\activemq start


if error found like
 If you get Address already in use (port 61616) or other bind errors:

   a) Check if ActiveMQ is already running by opening the web console:
      http://localhost:8161/admin
        — login admin / admin.
   b) If console does not open, find which process uses 61616:
    cmd -   netstat -ano | findstr 61616
      Kill the PID shown (replace <PID>):
    cmd -taskkill /PID <PID> /F

Then start again
    cmd - activemq.bat start


if you see in console something like
INFO | ActiveMQ WebConsole available at http://127.0.0.1:8161/

So open your browser and go to → http://localhost:8161/admin
Username: admin
Password: admin


✅ Step 2: Build your IntelliJ project

In IntelliJ’s bottom terminal, run:  mvn clean install
This compiles your code and ensures Maven dependencies are downloaded.
Wait for BUILD SUCCESS.

✅ Step 3: Run your ESBRoute (message routing logic)
Open ESBRoute.java.
Right-click in the code → Run 'ESBRoute.main()'.

This will start the Camel route that sends messages to/from ActiveMQ.

✅ Step 4 – Run the Subscribers (simulate multiple consumers)

These subscribers will listen to the topic NewsTopic that ESBRoute is publishing to.

🔹 Create two run configurations

Go to:
Run → Edit Configurations → + → Application

Fill in:

Name: Subscriber1

Main class: com.assignment.MessageSubscriber

Program arguments: Sub1

Use classpath of module: PubSubAssignment

Click Apply → OK

Repeat the same for Subscriber2

Name: Subscriber2

Main class: com.assignment.MessageSubscriber

Program arguments: Sub2

Apply → OK



Run Subscriber1, then Subscriber2.




✅ Step 5 – Run the REST Web Service


Now start your REST endpoint which publishes messages.

Open MessageWebService.java

Right-click → Run 'MessageWebService.main()'


You should see something like:

Server started on port 8080


✅ Step 6 – Test your REST endpoint

in Postman:

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:8080/publish

Content-Type: text/plain

Body → raw → text: Hello from REST API



✅ Step 7 – Verify in ActiveMQ Console

Go to
👉 http://localhost:8161/admin
 → Manage ActiveMQ broker → Topics

That confirms your message flowed through the whole distributed system:
REST Web Service → ActiveMQ → ESB Route → Subscribers
----------------------------------------------------
. Concept to Explain

This practical demonstrates publish-subscribe messaging using ActiveMQ with a REST service and Java subscribers.

Key components:

REST Web Service – publishes messages to a topic (NewsTopic).

ActiveMQ – message broker that manages topics and delivers messages to subscribers.

ESBRoute (Apache Camel) – acts as a route or middleware, forwarding messages from REST to ActiveMQ and subscribers.

Subscribers – multiple consumers (Subscriber1 and Subscriber2) listening to the topic and receiving messages in real-time.

Purpose: Show distributed messaging, multiple subscribers, and integration of REST with messaging middleware.

2. Practical Flow to Explain

You can explain it step by step as if telling a story:

Start ActiveMQ broker

Navigate to bin folder → activemq.bat start.

Confirm it’s running: http://localhost:8161/admin
 (login: admin/admin).

Handles any port errors if 61616 is in use.

ActiveMQ manages topics and distributes messages to subscribers.

Build the IntelliJ project

mvn clean install → ensures all dependencies are resolved and code is compiled.

Essential before running subscribers or REST service.

Run ESBRoute

Starts Apache Camel route for message routing.

This acts as a bridge between REST and ActiveMQ topic.

Run Subscribers

Create two run configurations in IntelliJ: Subscriber1 and Subscriber2.

Each connects to NewsTopic and listens for incoming messages.

Run both to simulate multiple consumers.

Output appears in subscriber console when a message is received.

Run REST Web Service

Starts a server on port 8080.

Exposes /publish endpoint that accepts POST requests with message content.

Test REST endpoint

Use Postman:

Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:8080/publish
Content-Type: text/plain
Body: Hello from REST API


This sends a message into the system.

Verify in ActiveMQ

Go to Topics → NewsTopic in ActiveMQ console.

Confirms:

Number of subscribers connected

Messages dispatched and dequeued

Demonstrates that the message was successfully published and delivered to all subscribers.

3. Key Points to Emphasize in Viva

Difference between Queue vs Topic:

Queue → 1 message → 1 consumer

Topic → 1 message → all active subscribers

Role of ESBRoute / Apache Camel: routes messages reliably between REST and ActiveMQ.

Role of Subscribers: demonstrate real-time message consumption.

REST API testing → shows how external clients can publish messages.

ActiveMQ Console → shows message flow, topic stats, and number of consumers.

✅ Tip for viva:

Draw a small diagram:

REST API → ESBRoute → ActiveMQ Topic (NewsTopic) → Subscriber1
                                           → Subscriber2


Point at each step while explaining the flow of a single message.

Mention 415 errors (if asked) → caused by wrong Content-Type in REST request.
